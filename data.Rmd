library(readxl)

nyc_df = read_csv(file = "./data/nyc_clean.csv")
```

*   `r names(nyc_df[1])`: the year of death
*   `r names(nyc_df[2])`: the cause of death
*   `r names(nyc_df[3])`: the decedent's sex
*   `r names(nyc_df[4])`: the decedent's ethnicity
*   `r names(nyc_df[5])`: the number of people who died due to cause of death
*   `r names(nyc_df[6])`: the death rate within the sex and race/ethnicity category
