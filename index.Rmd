### **Motivation**

The goal of the project is to examine the leading causes of death at a micro-level (New York City) and at a macro-level (nationwide). Cause of death statistics including information about the total number of people who die each year and the reason for their death is important for measuring the effectiveness of a country’s health system. For example, if deaths from heart ailments are rising rapidly over the years in one country, this trend can help government authorities decide on the focus of their surveillance and response programs in order to reduce preventable deaths. Therefore, obtaining high quality cause-of-death data and appropriate analyses are crucial for improving public health actions. 

### **Related work**

Originally, we were going to look at the impact of COVID-19 on the trends of commercial activity (foot traffic) in the travel, hospitality, and restaurant industries in the U.S based on the data from Safe Graph. However, the datasets we were able to get access to did not have enough data points and we decided to work with a different topic. We were inspired to investigate leading causes of death using data from NYC Open Data and CDC because in the face of a pandemic, it is easy to forget about preventive care. While the cause of death data we used is not the most up-to-date and does not show excess deaths related to COVID-19, we thought it was still important to learn more about the list of diseases for which routine care might not be delivered at the recommended levels due to the pandemic. The fact that data on the underlying leading causes of death is widely available further motivated us to pursue this topic. 

### **Initial questions**

1. What is the general trend of leading causes of death over time in the US and NYC?
2. How do the leading causes of death in NYC compare to the nationwide trends?
3. Are there any gender differences in leading causes of death in NYC?
4. Are there any ethnicity differences in leading causes of death in NYC?
5. Is there a statistically significant difference in death rates between men and women     in New York City?
6. Is there a statistically significant difference in death rates across different ethnicities in New York City? 

Initially, we planned on answering question 3 and question 4 by only using descriptive analytical tools such as plotting. After making inferences on the final plots, we wanted to identify if the differences in death counts were truly significant. As a result, we formulated the following follow-up questions to investigate further: 

7. Are there significant differences in the leading causes of death between men and women in NYC? 
8. Are there significant differences in the top 2 leading causes of death across different ethnicities in NYC?

### **Data**

The data used in this project was retrieved primarily from two sources, [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us) and [CDC](https://data.cdc.gov/browse?category=NCHS&sortBy=last_modified). Specifically, the “New York City Leading Causes of Death” dataset published on the NYC Open Data website was used to analyze the leading causes of death in NYC. Additionally, the dataset available on the National Center for Health Statistics from the CDC was used to analyze the overall leading causes of death in the US. More details on the datasets can be found in the [Data](data.html) tab of this website. 

#### Data Cleaning
While these public data generated by government agencies are generally relatively tidy, as part of the data cleaning procedure, the raw datasets were modified in the following ways. 

* Missing values were recoded as NAs. 
* Irrelevant or redundant rows were removed (e.g., All causes). 
* Variable types were converted to a category that is appropriate for analysis (e.g., character to numeric). 
* The variable names for causes of death and ethnicity groups were cleaned and shortened to make them easier to visualize. 

#### Data Challenges 

* Different cause of death categories: Although the datasets were already relatively clean, we decided not to merge the two datasets because some of the categories for the causes of death did not overlap between the two datasets and we did not have the clinical background to ensure that the reassignment or merging of those categories is correct. However, the plots still allowed us to make informative comparisons. 

* Fragmented data: Additionally, for the NYC dataset, some of the leading causes were not collected all throughout the years so the data was fragmented for some of the causes. We considered using the nationwide dataset only and filter for New York state but it did not have the gender-level and ethnicity-level information that the NYC dataset provided so we decided to use both separately and focus specifically on New York City for additional analyses. 

### **Exploratory analysis**

#### Trends of leading causes of death over time 

* To explore the question of how leading causes of death changed over time, we created animated column plots and time series plots that show the leading causes per year and how the order of that list changes per year for both the nationwide dataset and the NYC-only dataset. 

* These plots demonstrated that the top 2 leading causes of death remained the same for US as a whole and for New York City, which was not surprising given that the rank order of top 2 leading causes of death have remained generally the same since 1999. 

* However, there was some variability in the order of the rest of the leading causes of death for New York City, which makes sense given that there may be some epidemiologic factors that are unique to the city that make certain diseases more prevalent compared to other cities.    

#### Racial/Gender differences of leading causes of death

* To explore the question of whether there were racial or gender differences in the leading cuases of death in New York City, we created grouped bar plots and time series plots that show how the leading causes of death in New York City change by ethnicity and by sex. 

* These plots demonstrated that the trends for the top 2 leading causes of death in general seem to follow the nationwide trend (e.g., deaths due to heart diseases going down while deaths due to cancer going up slightly). 

* However, there were some ethnicity groups (e.g., Asians and Other race) that showed a contrasting trend, which may be due to the fact that there have been some changes in the lifestyle factors or genetic factors that make certain ethnicity groups more or less susceptible to these diseases.  

### **Additional analysis**

After inspecting the visualizations, we decided to run statistical analyses to formally test various hypotheses investigating the differences in deaths in New York City based on factors such as gender, race  or causes of death. Summary tables and boxplots were provided as apart of statistical testing to investigate relevant data distribution of specific subsets of the original dataset. 

* In order to test for significant differences in death rates between men and women, a Wilcoxon rank sum test was performed. A non-parametric approach was adopted because the normality assumption was violated. This was observed from the qqplot and the Shapiro–Wilk test. Based on the Wilcoxon rank sum test output, we concluded that there is significant difference in death rates in men and women in New York City. 

* Similarly, an appropriate statistical test was performed to investigate significant differences in death rates across the various ethnicities. Since the normality and homogeneity of variances assumptions were violated, Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test
was conducted. The relevant test result indicated that there is significant difference in death rates across different ethnicities in New York City. 

* To answer the question whether there are significant differences in the leading causes of death between men and women in New York City, we initially performed a two-way ANOVA test. We specifically chose type III test, which accounted for the unequal distribution of sample size within the observed groups.Following that, we observed that the normality and homogeneity of variances assumptions were violated. Aligned Rank Transformed ANOVA for two-way procedure was performed to account for the non-parametric nature of the data. The full model also tested the interaction effect between sex and the leading causes of death factors. The statistical test output provided the evidence to conclude that the leading causes of deaths (Diseases of Heart, Malignant Neoplasms, Diabetes Mellitus and Chronic Lower Respiratory Diseases) is the only factor associated with significant death counts in the New York City. 

* In order to investigate if there are any significant differences in the top 2 leading causes of death across different ethnicities in New York City, we followed an approach that was very similar to the previous statistical test. Aligned Rank Transformed ANOVA for two-way procedure was conducted because the assumptions associated with the two-way ANOVA test were not satisfied. The full model was tested, which also included the interaction term along with race and leading causes of death factors. The final test result indicated that race, the top two leading causes of death and the respective interaction term are associated with significant death counts in New York City. 

### **Discussion**

The results of our project indicate a few important findings: 

* Top 2 leading causes of death in New York City are the same as the top 2 leading causes of death in the U.S. from 2007 to 2014. 
* Similar to the nationwide trend, deaths due to heart diseases seem to be on a declining trend while deaths due to cancer seem to show an increasing trend in New York City from 2007 to 2014. 
* There may be some ethnicity groups in New York City for which these trends may be accentuated or reversed. 
* There are some leading causes of death in New York City that do not overlap with the top 10 leading causes of death in the U.S. 
* There may be some gender differences in the leading causes of death in New York City.
