### The group members (names and UNIs)

  - Chloe Chah (yc3727)
  - Mehr Shafiq (ms5965)

### The tentative project title

Leading causes of death in New York City (2007-2014)

### The motivation for this project

The goal of the project is to examine the leading causes of death at a
micro-level (New York City) and at a macro-level (nationwide).

### The intended final products

Summary level tables and dashboard that visualize the comparison of the
leading causes of death in NYC vs. those in the entire country, as well
as leading causes of death by sex and race/ethnicity, look at trends
over time, and conduct statistical analysis to gauge whether any of the
differences are statistically significant.

### The anticipated data sources

[Leading Causes of Death in
NYC](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/New-York-City-Leading-Causes-of-Death/jb7j-dtam)

[Leading Causes of Death in the
U.S.](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/NCHS-Leading-Causes-of-Death-United-States/bi63-dtpu)

### The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

  - Trends over time (death rate vs. age-adjusted)  
  - Top leading causes of death by sex/race
  - Compare NY to other states
  - Statistical analysis
