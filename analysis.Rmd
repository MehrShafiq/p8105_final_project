<details>

* It appears that from 2007 to 2014, deaths due to malignant neoplasms in NYC also showed an increasing trend but the change is not as drastic as in the nationwide plot, while deaths due to diseases of heart showed a declining trend, similar to the U.S. plot.  
* We originally wanted to show changes in top 3 leading causes for NYC as well similar to the US time series plot, but a lot of the data was fragmented (e.g. not available for all the years) for causes other than "All Other Causes" and we didn't think it was meaningful to include "All Other Causes" as one of the top causes for this plot, so we decided to just include "Malignant Neoplasms" and "Diseases of Heart".

```

<details>
<summary> Description </summary>

* It appears that the general trends in the top 2 leading causes in NYC varied by race/ethnicity. One noticeable contrast that stands out is that deaths due to malignant neoplams seem to be on a steeper increasing trend for Asians/Pacific Islanders and Other race/ethnicity in NYC unlike for rest of the ethnicity groups. 
* Another noticeable difference is that deaths due to diseases of heart seem to be on an increasing trend for Other race/ethnicity in NYC unlike for rest of the ethnicity groups.

<details>
<summary> Description </summary>

From the boxplot visualization and the p-values (< 0.05) associated with the The Shapiro–Wilks test, there is evidence that the data from both the sex groups is not normally distributed. This is also evident from the qqplot above.     

Since the normality assumption has been violated, the Wilcoxon rank sum test (non-parametric) will be performed.

At 0.05 significance level, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in death rates across different ethnicity , in New York City.

__Multiple Comparisons__

A Tukey pairwise-comparisons test is performed to account for multiple comparisons.<br>

Levene’s test was performed to check for the homogeneity of variances assumption. Based on the p-value, it can be inferred that there is no homogeneity of variances in different ethnicity .

mod_residuals = residuals(object = mod.aov)

shapiro.test(x = mod_residuals) 
```

<details>
<summary> Description </summary>

Since the p-value < 0.00000000000000022, it can be assumed that the residuals are not normally distributed. Therefore, a Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test will be performed because the assumptions of one-way ANOVA have been violated.

* The leading causes of deaths (Diseases of Heart, Malignant Neoplasms, Diabetes   Mellitus and Chronic Lower Respiratory Diseases) are associated with significant death counts in the New York City (p = 0.000001394). 
* The sex variable and the interaction term (sex and leading causes of death variable) don't have any significant association with death counts in New York City

Levene’s test was performed to check for the homogeneity of variances assumption. Based on the p-value, it can be inferred that there is no homogeneity of variances in the observed groups.

Since the p-value < 0.05, it can be assumed that the residuals are not normally distributed. Therefore, a Aligned Rank Transformed ANOVA will be performed because the assumptions of two-way ANOVA have been violated.

Based on the Aligned Rank Transformed ANOVA for two-way procedure result, there is evidence to state that the leading causes of deaths (Diseases of Heart, Malignant Neoplasms, Diabetes   Mellitus and Chronic Lower Respiratory Diseases) is the only factor associated with significant death counts in the New York City (p < 0.05).<br>

__Report__

Based on the Aligned Rank Transformed ANOVA for two-way procedure result, there is evidence to state that all the factor (race_ethnicity, leading_cause and interaction term) are associated with significant death counts in the New York City (p < 0.000000000000000222). Therefore, it is safe to state that there are significant differences in the top 2 leading causes of death across different ethnicity  in NYC.
